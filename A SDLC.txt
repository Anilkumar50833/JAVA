SDLC
=====
SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle.

SDLC is a process adopt by IT industry to develop accurate and quality of softwares.

There are six phases in SDLC.

1)Feasibility study 

2)Analysis 

3)Designing 

4)Coding 

5)Testing 

6)Delivery and Maintainence

1)Feasibility study 
--------------------
This phase is completely depends on "TELOS" formulea.
ex:
	T - Technical Feasibility
	E - Economical Feasibility
	L - Legal Feasibility
	O - Operational Feasibility
	S - Schedule Feasibility

All the above information they will keep in a document called BDD.

BDD stands for Business Design Document.


2)Analysis phase
----------------
In analysis phase  system analyst or product owner will involved.

They will seperate system requirements and software requirements. 

That information they will keep in a document called SRS.

SRS stands for Software Requirement Specification.


3)Designing phase
------------------
We have two types of designing.

1)High Level Designing 
--------------------
	In high level designing we will design major/main modules.
	Manager is responsible to perform high level designing.

2)Low Level Designing 
--------------------
	In low level designing we will design child/sub modules.
	Team Lead/Project Lead is responsible to perform low level designing.

Above information they will keep in a document called PDD/TDD.
PDD stands for Project Design Document.
TDD stands for Technical Design Document.


4)Coding phase
----------------
In this phase developers will involved.

A developer is responsible to generate the code (Build).

Before sending the build to testing team , developer is responsible to perform 
white box testing.


5) Testing phase 
------------------
In this phase , testing team or QA team will involved.

Team team will test our build by using a software component called STLC.

STLC stands for Software Testing Life Cycle.

After STLC , A testing team is responsible to perform black box testing.


6) Delivery and Maintainence
---------------------------
Before delivery of project  we will perform UAT testing.

UAT stands User Acceptance Testing.

UAT testing divided into two types.

	i) Alpha testing 

	ii) Beta testing
